# Hangman Game in Python

A simple and fun Hangman game built using Python. The game selects a word from a predefined list, and the player must guess the letters of the word before running out of attempts.  

## How to Play
1. The game will display a series of underscores ( _ ) representing the letters in the word.
2. You must guess one letter at a time.
3. If the guessed letter is correct, it will be revealed in its corresponding position.
4. If the guessed letter is incorrect, you'll lose one attempt.
5. The game ends when you either guess the word or run out of attempts.
